[[English](README.md) | [Português](README.pt.md)]

Welcome to Hurb's mobile team coding challenge!

We are always looking to expand our team with dedicated devs, see if you have open positions in our [Gupy](https://hurb.gupy.io/), if you don't have an open position, send a message on LinkedIn or open an issue.

The challenge is to create a mobile app (**Swift**, **Kotlin**) that consumes the JSON exposed by our REST API or GraphQL search and presents the information in a listing. You are free to use third-party libraries.

We want to see the **maximum of your technical ability**! You decide the limit.

## Minimum requirements

-   Fork this challenge and create your project (or workspace) using your version of that repository, as soon as you finish the challenge, submit a _pull request_.
    -   If you have any reason not to submit a _pull request_, create a private repository on Github, do every challenge on the **master** branch and don't forget to fill in the `pull-request.txt` file. As soon as you finish your development, add the user `automator-hurb` to your repository as a contributor and make it available for at least 30 days. **Do not add the `automator-hurb` until development is complete.**
    -   If you have any problem creating the private repository, at the end of the challenge fill in the file called `pull-request.txt`, compress the project folder - including the `.git` folder - and send it to us by email.
-   Make asynchronous calls to the API and log the data received.

-   Have tests for the code created

## Evaluation criteria

-   **Organization of code**: Separation of modules, view and model, back-end and front-end

-   **Clarity**: Does the README explain briefly what the problem is and how can I run the application?

-   **Assertiveness**: Is the application doing what is expected? If something is missing, does the README explain why?

-   **Code readability** (including comments)

-   **Security**: Are there any clear vulnerabilities?

-   **Test coverage** (We don't expect full coverage)

-   **History of commits** (structure and quality)

-   **UX**: Is the interface user-friendly and self-explanatory? Is the API intuitive?

-   **Technical choices**: Is the choice of libraries, database, architecture, etc. the best choice for the application?

-   **"Something more"**: Was any feature not described in the minimum requirements added? Was it well executed? Does it bring any interesting innovations?

## Doubts

Any questions you may have, check the [_issues_](https://github.com/HurbCom/challenge-alpha/issues) to see if someone hasn't already and if you can't find your answer, open one yourself. new issue!
